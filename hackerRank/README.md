[Counting Sort](https://github.com/SebastianArriagada/python-work/blob/main/hackerRank/CountingSort1.py): Another sorting method, the counting sort, does not require comparison. Instead, you create an integer array whose index range covers the entire range of values in your array to sort.

[Diagonal Difference](https://github.com/SebastianArriagada/python-work/blob/main/hackerRank/DiagonalDifference.py): Given a square matrix, calculate the absolute difference between the sums of its diagonals.

[Flipping Bits](https://github.com/SebastianArriagada/python-work/blob/main/hackerRank/FlippingBits.py): You will be given a list of 32 bit unsigned integers. Flip all the bits ( 1 -> 0 and 0 -> 1) and return the result as an unsigned integer.

[Lonely Integer](https://github.com/SebastianArriagada/python-work/blob/main/hackerRank/LonelyInteger.py): Given an array of integers, where all elements but one occur twice, find the unique element.

[Pangrams](https://github.com/SebastianArriagada/python-work/blob/main/hackerRank/Pangrams.py): Prints a line containing pangram if a is a pangram, otherwise it prints not pangram

[Permuting Two Arrays](https://github.com/SebastianArriagada/python-work/blob/main/hackerRank/PermutingTwoArrays.py): Giving two arrays of integers, permute them according a specific relation

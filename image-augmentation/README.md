# image-augmentation
Contains image augmentation tools for object detection models, made by myself (for fun)

## Possible image augmentation:

* **flip**: Flip the image and labels horizontal, vertical or both
* **rotate**: Rotate the image and label in 90ยบ, 180ยบ and 270ยบ (ToDO, any angle)
* **zoom**: Make positive zoom to the image and cut it in a random position, adjust the labels coordinates (ToDO, negative zoom)

# Conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN)

CGAN is a deep learning method where a conditional setting is applied, meaning that both the generator and discriminator are conditioned on some sort of auxiliary information such as class labels or data from other modalities.

Segmentation of areas of interest applying image-to-image translation. The main project was about segmenting mineralization zones, but due to confidentiality issues, it will be carried out with detail applied to the CityScapes database, to make possible the segmentation of its different labels.

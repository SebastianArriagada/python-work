Essentially it is the number of features that we choose to represent each word. For example, the word 'man' can be represented by the features (gender, living being, age, IQ, etc...). Because the dataset has many words, the bigger the embedding dimension, the better the model is able to understand different words by having a variety of features. This allows the model to learn similarities / differences between words.\n","- **attention_dim = 2048** --> This hyperparameter corresponds to the attention network dimension, which essentially refers to the number of nodes of the Linear layer. Given that the attention derives scores for input elements in relation to outputs, this parameter was expected to be a high number due to the encoder output which is a small fixed 14 sized vector. Because of such low dimensionality, a small attention network would not be able to find relevant features. In addition, because the attention network also looks at the embeddings of the tokens which are of high dimensionality, the attention_dim should also be big.\n","- **decoder_dim = 2048** --> Usually the decoder dimension relates to the encoder dimension. However, because of the attention network, the decoder receives weighted features (by the attention scores) from the attention network which has high dimensionality, therefore, the decoder_dim should also be high. This is not proven by the literature, but it worked for me. However, because of the low encoder output 14 sized vector, I suspect that lower values could have worked well also.\n","- **dropout = 0.3** --> This hyperparameter is a regularizer that helps the model avoid overfitting. If you look at the code you would see that this dropout is used only at the Decoder with Attention part after the final layers, before the prediction. Because most of the processing is already done by the network, the final layers try to make sense out of the extracted features, therefore, a small dropout value is desired. This is because dropout neutralizes (makes it zero) random neurons, so there are chances of losing very important information. Thus, smaller probabilities for the dropout are desirable at the final layers.\n","- **epochs = 10** --> My network is big enough, so a small number of epochs should be enough.\n","- **batch_size = 16** --> My network is big enough, batch size shouldn't be too big to avoid Colab to crash\n","- **fine_tune_encoder = True ; encoder_lr = 0.001 ; decoder_lr = 0.01** --> The encoder is based on a ResNet50 pre-trained on ImageNet. This task was using the COCO dataset, therefore the encoder should be fine_tuned in order to update its weights for learning about the COCO dataset. In addition, due to the fact that the encoder is pre-trained (has already some knowledge) and the decoder is a LSTM from scratch (random weights), the encoder_lr should be smaller than the decoder_lr. \n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["\n","PS: The warning in the evaluation is not desirable but because it was from an implementation mistake form my side, I did not take that into consideration for this assignment.
